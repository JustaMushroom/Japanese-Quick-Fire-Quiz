# Japanese Quick Fire Quiz
A small program made for learning Japanese kana characters
The program contains three features: A Hiragana Test, a Katakana test and a Mixed test:
* The Hiragana test only tests on hiragana characters (e.g. あ、い、う、え、お)
* The Katakana test only tests on katakana characters (e.g. ア、イ、ウ、エ、オ)
* The Mixed test uses both hiragana and katakana characters (e.g. ア、い、ウ、え、オ)

Despite being called a "Quick Fire Quiz", there is no time limit on questions.
The GUI version does contain a stopwatch, however there are no time limits.
You are able to take as long as you want on each individual question
